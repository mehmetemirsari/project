# Study Register System

This project was developed as part of a university programming course.

The purpose of the project is to build a simple study register system that can
store and manage information about students, courses, and completed studies.
The program runs in the terminal and uses text (CSV-style) files for data storage.

## What the program does
- Reads student, course, and completion data from text files
- Allows adding new students to the system
- Enables searching for students and courses
- Records completed courses with grades and dates
- Provides a menu-based interface for user interaction

## How to run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Place the following files in the same directory:
   - `project.py`
   - `students.txt`
   - `courses.txt`
   - `passed.txt`
3. Run the program using:
python project.py
## Data files
- `students.txt` – stores student information
- `courses.txt` – stores course information
- `passed.txt` – stores completed courses with grades and dates

The program reads from and writes to these files during execution.

## Technologies used
- Python
- File handling with CSV-style text files

## Notes
This project focuses on practicing problem-solving, file handling,
and following detailed project requirements.
